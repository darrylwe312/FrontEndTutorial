            Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream, "Cheers!"
            Get your two-step 'cause this the record of the year! Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, two for a pair!
            Officially announcing, "This is warfare"! 'Cause
            Back in the day, my clouds was grey and it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away...

            Pharrell's name has become somewhat synonymous with luxury collaborations, but his sunglasses collection with then-Louis Vuitton Creative Director Marc Jacobs in 2004 was his very first. Long time friend Abloh re-issued the colorful collection with gold details in 2018, with pairs originally retailing for $300 to $500 and then upwards of $1,700 for resale. When the shades originally dropped, Pharrell told Women's Wear Daily, "You have to understand, I am just a regular dude. At the end of the day, this is all an incredible dream come true." He then added, "He is Marc Jacobs and it is Louis Vuitton, and who am I for that matter?"
